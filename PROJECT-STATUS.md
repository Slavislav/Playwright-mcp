## Competition Workflow

### Using Playwright MCP + K6

1. **Reconnaissance (5 min)**
   - Use Playwright MCP to explore the target application
   - Navigate through key modules and features
   - Capture network requests

2. **Endpoint Discovery (5 min)**
   - Use `mcp_Playwright_browser_network_requests` to capture API calls
   - Document discovered endpoints
   - Note authentication flow

3. **K6 Test Selection (2 min)**
   - Choose appropriate template from `k6/` directory
   - Consider test type based on requirements

4. **Customization (5 min)**
   - Update `BASE_URL` in chosen K6 template
   - Configure discovered endpoints
   - Add authentication if needed
   - Adjust load parameters

5. **Validation (3 min)**
   - Run with 1 VU: `k6 run --vus 1 --duration 30s script.js`
   - Verify all endpoints work
   - Fix any connection issues

6. **Execution (5 min)**
   - Run full load test
   - Monitor for errors
   - Wait for completion

7. **Analysis (5 min)**
   - Open generated `summary.html` report
   - Review metrics and thresholds
   - Document findings

**Total Time: ~30 minutes**

## Quick Commands Reference

### Playwright MCP (Endpoint Discovery)
```javascript
// Navigate to application
mcp_Playwright_browser_navigate({ url: "https://target-app.com" })

// Capture network traffic
mcp_Playwright_browser_network_requests()

// Login flow
mcp_Playwright_browser_type({ element: "username", text: "admin" })
mcp_Playwright_browser_click({ element: "login button" })
```

### K6 Load Testing
```bash
# Validate with 1 user
k6 run --vus 1 --duration 30s script.js

# Run full test
k6 run script.js

# Custom load
k6 run --vus 50 --duration 5m script.js

# With environment variables
k6 run -e BASE_URL=https://target.com script.js
```

## Key Files to Modify for New Competition

### 1. K6 Test Script
```javascript
// Update at the top of chosen template
const BASE_URL = 'https://new-target.com';
const USERNAME = 'discovered-username';
const PASSWORD = 'discovered-password';
```

### 2. Playwright Config (Optional)
```typescript
// playwright-base-project/playwright.config.ts
baseURL: 'https://new-target.com'
```

## Competition Tips

1. **Start Small**: Always validate with 1 VU first
2. **Use Playwright MCP**: Best for discovering endpoints quickly
3. **Pick Right Template**: Match template to test requirements
4. **Don't Over-Engineer**: Speed matters in competitions
5. **Document As You Go**: Keep notes on discovered endpoints
6. **Watch Thresholds**: Set realistic pass/fail criteria
7. **Generate Reports**: HTML reports are your evidence
