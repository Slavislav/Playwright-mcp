## Process Overview
The Test Plan generation follows this systematic approach:

### Phase 1: Input Analysis
- Analyze SUT Overview document for comprehensive system understanding
- Reference PROJECT-SYSTEM-MESSAGE.md for competition scoring criteria
- Review Test Plan Knowledge Base for document structure requirements
- Identify critical areas requiring focused Playwright MCP exploration

### Phase 2: Targeted Data Gathering
- Use Playwright MCP to gather specific Test Plan data from SUT
- Focus on risk identification, scope definition, and resource requirements
- Capture realistic timeline and scheduling information
- Document systematic approach and tool usage evidence

### Phase 3: Test Plan Document Generation
- Create comprehensive Test Plan following knowledge base structure
- Optimize content for ISTQB competition scoring (20 points)
- Generate professional HTML output using template design
- Ensure all scoring criteria are thoroughly addressed

## Detailed Process Instructions

### Step 1: Input Analysis & Preparation
```
1. Read and analyze the SUT Overview document (from SUT-Overview-Generation-Prompt.md or reference document)
2. Review PROJECT-SYSTEM-MESSAGE.md for Test Plan scoring criteria:
   - Coverage of product risks
   - Clear scope and realistic time management
   - Use of tools and systematic approach
   - Avoid focusing only on one test type or creating unworkable schedules
3. Reference Test-Plan/test-plan-knowledge-base.md for document structure
4. Identify specific areas requiring additional Playwright MCP exploration
```

### Step 2: Targeted Playwright MCP Exploration
```
1. Navigate to SUT using provided URL and credentials
2. Focus on gathering Test Plan specific data:
   - Risk identification: Critical business functions, failure points
   - Scope definition: In-scope vs out-of-scope functionality
   - Resource requirements: Tools, environments, team needs
   - Timeline validation: Realistic scheduling based on system complexity
   - Systematic approach evidence: Tool usage, methodologies
3. Capture screenshots and data for Test Plan documentation
4. Document any limitations or constraints discovered
```

### Step 3: Test Plan Document Generation
```
1. Create comprehensive Test Plan document addressing all scoring criteria:
   - Executive Summary with risk-based approach
   - Detailed scope covering all critical system areas
   - Realistic timeline with proper resource allocation
   - Systematic methodology with tool integration
   - Risk coverage and mitigation strategies
2. Structure content according to test-plan-knowledge-base.md
3. Generate HTML output using Documents/template.html design
4. Include competition context and team information
5. Ensure professional, competition-ready presentation
```

## Test Plan Scoring Optimization

### Critical Success Factors (20 Points)
**Coverage of Product Risks:**
- Identify and document all critical business risks
- Prioritize risks based on impact and likelihood
- Include mitigation strategies for each risk category
- Demonstrate comprehensive risk understanding

**Clear Scope and Realistic Time Management:**
- Define precise in-scope and out-of-scope functionality

- Allocate appropriate resources for each testing phase
- Include buffer time for unexpected issues

**Use of Tools and Systematic Approach:**
- Document Playwright MCP usage for system exploration
- Reference systematic methodology (ISTQB principles)
- Include tool selection rationale and usage strategy
- Demonstrate professional testing approach

**Avoid Penalty Points:**
- Cover multiple test types (functional, integration, system, etc.)
- Create workable schedule with realistic milestones
- Balance comprehensive coverage with time constraints
- Ensure all recommendations are executable
